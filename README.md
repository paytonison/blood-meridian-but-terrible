## Summary
*The Sundown Stranger* follows Felix, a young rancher living in a small desert town called Grey Springs, who idolizes a mysterious, unnamed gunslinger known only as “the Stranger.” The Stranger has a legendary reputation for protecting the town from outlaws and vanishing without a trace. Felix is deeply fascinated—possibly romantically—with the Stranger, who once offered to take Felix on the road with them.

One year after the Stranger’s last appearance, Felix is running errands in town when a group of criminals ambushes the train yard. During the ensuing shootout, Felix joins the fight and kills one of the outlaws, earning admiration from the townspeople. The Stranger arrives shortly afterward, retrieving a book from the dead outlaw’s possession. When questioned, the Stranger gives cryptic answers and avoids explaining the book’s contents.

Sheriff McCashland, injured during the attack, reveals the book is a ledger crucial to monitoring illegal trade. Realizing the Stranger has ulterior motives, Felix confronts them. The two shoot each other in a final standoff, both fatally wounded. As Felix dies, he reflects on broken illusions and the promised world he’ll never see, ending with a poetic image of them “riding off into the sunset” together.

The story blends Western and coming-of-age elements with themes of hero worship, disillusionment, and betrayal.
